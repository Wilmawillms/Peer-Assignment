# R program in finding an inverse matrix
  
# Before finding the inverse matrix we need to establish the matrix itself 
# we need to make 3 vectors to create a 3 by 3 matrix
# using combine method.
a1 <- c(2, -3, 1)
a2 <- c(2, 0, -1)
a3 <- c(1, 4, 5)
  
# Now that we have the three vectors we need to combine them so that r recognize it as matrix 
# I will use rbind()
# This function is known asrow-wise binding.
A <- rbind(a1, a2, a3)
  
#  I will print the original matrix to solve
print(A)
  
# By closing this with a print function then this will calculate the matrix
# In this segment this will be the function on performing inverse matrix
W1 <- solve(A)
  
# print the inverse of the matrix.
print(W1)
